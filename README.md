# Project_2

The purpose of this project is to find out if there is a relationship between countries winning in Summer Olympic and their demographies.

Olympic data sets between 1960 - 2014 were collected from Kaggle and the participating country's information e.g. GDP and Polpulation were collected from World Bank.

The data collected was cleaned and transformed to have relevence between variables in pandas.

The Datasets were then loaded to a relational database for easier and meaningful queries.
